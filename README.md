# Faktor
The impact factor (Faktor) of a scientific journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to 
articles published in science journals.
For this task we are using a simplified formula for calculating the impact factor:
Total counts of citations received for articles published in the journal / Total no of articles published
Rounding is always performed upwards. For example the impact factor of the 
“Journal for ore research and time wasting” that published 38 articles cited 894 times is 894/38=23.53 rounding up to 24.

You are the editor of one scientific journal. You know how many articles you are 
going to publish and the owners are pushing you to reach a specific impact factor. 
You are wondering how many scientists you will have to bribe to cite your articles to meet the owners demands. 
Since money is tight you want to bribe the minimal amount of scientists. Each bribed scientist buys you a single citation.

Input will be a single line containing the no of articles, followed by desired impact factor, eg 2 98
And output will be minimum number of bribes. Note: articles and impact factor lie between 1 and 100
